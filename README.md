Manage, control and transmit multiple FM signals easily.

## Problem

Many times during buddhist teachings in monasteries, the audio is translated live and broadcast over FM locally. For every translator, there is a separate FM transmitter and antenna needed. This can get difficult and complex to manage as the number of translators increase.

## Solution

Streamline the FM transmission and antennas part of the setup by feeding all the audio signals into **one** computer, and have a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) connected to that computer that produces all the required transmissions at the same time. This will simplify the setup so that one antenna, one transmitter, and one radio frequency transmission cable will be needed. The additional complexity that will be introduced will be an additional computer, and a GUI interface running on it to manage this setup.
